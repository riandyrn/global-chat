# Global Chat

Simple yet scalable one global room chat application ;)

This project is meant to help me understand how to scale up chat application. Thus the feature of this application is very simple. It only can join to single global room, then user can publish the message where all of the user joined can read the message.

The server is written in golang & the client itself is written by using simple html, css, javascript, & jquery (though I plan to use Vue.js later since it seems much simpler).
